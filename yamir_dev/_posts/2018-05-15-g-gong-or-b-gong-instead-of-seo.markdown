I suggest “G Gong” or “B Gong” instead of SEO
=============================================

Mandarin Chinese 氣／气 (qì) means life force.  See [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chi](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chi)

Mandarin Chinese character 功 (gong) means achievement or cultivation or work or accomplishment.  See [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8A%9F](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8A%9F)

Qi Gong means the cultivation of energy.  See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong)

So, by derivation, G Gong would mean the cultivation of G.  When thinking of the letter G, I think Google.

And, B Gong would be the cultivation of B.  When thinking of the letter B, I think of Bing.

As you know, SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization.  See 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)

My argument is that it would be more meaningful (and would require one less syllable) to use “G Gong” or “B Gong” instead of SEO.

So, you would say something like: “We need to improve our website’s G Gong.”

What do you think?
