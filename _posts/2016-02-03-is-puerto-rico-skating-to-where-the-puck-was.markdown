Is Puerto Rico Skating to where the Puck was, to where the Puck is, or to where the Puck is going to be?

I was recently browsing the software and services that the so called "Unicorns" use at [https://siftery.com/groups/unicorns](https://siftery.com/groups/unicorns) and it struck me how little this resembles what the people I interact with use.  

So my question became, is Puerto Rico even skating to where the puck is?
What do you think?
