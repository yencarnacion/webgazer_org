Bitcoin's Manifest Destiny
==========================
The satoshi is currently the smallest unit of the Bitcoin currency recorded on the block chain.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> It is a one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC).  At the time of this writing, a satoshi is worth $ 0.00008920 in US Dollars.  So, a satoshi is not even close to being worth one cent as I write this.

I write this note on April 20, 2018 to be on the record with the position that it is Bitcoin’s manifest destiny to have a its smallest unit (currently the satoshi) be worth something and for me that means at least one cent.  The mathematical result of a satoshi being worth one cent is that 1 Bitcoin would be worth 1 million dollars.

Thinking about Bitcoin’s smallest unit being worth something baked my noodle in terms of the upside possibilities given that today 1 Bitcoin is trading for close to $ 8,920.

And yes, I borrowed the phrase “manifest destiny” from a different context. <sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>
