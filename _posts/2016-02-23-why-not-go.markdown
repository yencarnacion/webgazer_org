Why not Go?
================
I wanted to share with you some performance data comparing the time it takes out to print "Hello World!\n" in a couple of popular server side languages.  

You can see that Go outperformed everything else handily.  

So my question to you is, why are we not using Go more in Puerto Rico? I don't think this language gets enough attention in Puerto Rico.  As to the "the lack of available trained software developers in Go" excuse, I submit to you that most software developers should be able to pick the basics of the language in less than a week.

Here is the software I used for the test:  
go version go1.6 darwin/amd64  
node version v5.6.0  
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_40-b27)  
Groovy Version: 2.4.6 JVM: 1.8.0_40 Vendor: Oracle Corporation OS: Mac OS X  
Mono release is: 4.2 SR1 (4.2.2.30)  

> `hello.go`  

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
        fmt.Printf("Hello World!\n")
}
```

> `hello.js` (Node.js)  

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!\n");
```


> `Hello.java`  

```java
public class Hello {
   public static void main(String[] args){
      System.out.println("Hello World!\n");
   }
}
```

> `hello.groovy`  

```groovy
System.out.println("Hello World!\n");
```

> `hello.cs` (C#) 

```csharp
using System;
 
public class HelloWorld
{
    static public void Main ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Hello World!\n");
    }
}
```
