Will Serverless kill the Full Stack Developer Role
=================================================

The role of the full stack developer seems to be diminishing.  See 
[Full-Stack Development in the Era of Serverless Computing](https://medium.com/@dabit3/full-stack-development-in-the-era-of-serverless-computing-c1e49bba8580)
 written by Nader Dabit.

Today, a front-end developer can hook into the services of a “serverless” provider 
(like Google’s Firebase) and create a “Google class” application with little or no
back-end code at a fraction of the time and cost of what was previously possible.

This blog post is not without a sense of irony. This blog is hosted on firebase 
(a "serverless" provider") at the time of this post's original publication (and I am a
Full Stack Developer).
