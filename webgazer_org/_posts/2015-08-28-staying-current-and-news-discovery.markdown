Hello, my name is Yamir and Iâ€™m a news addict.  

I read the news every day.  In this article I share with you many of the the ways that I have tried to consume the daily news.  Of the list, my daily routine incorporates Zite, Flipboard, and PressDisplay on an iPad.  The rest I include only because they may appeal more to others than to myself.  

If you have a way to consume the news that I have not listed I would love to hear about it.
