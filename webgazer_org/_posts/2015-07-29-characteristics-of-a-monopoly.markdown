This post summarizes Peter Thiel's characteristics of a monopoly from his book *Zero to One* (which I recommend).  

In his book, Peter argues that a Tech Monopoly has the following characteristics:

* Proprietary Technology
  * It must be 10x better than what is out there.
* Network Effects
  * It provides a base value but it gets more valuable when more people use it.
* Economies of Scale
  * It gets cheaper to produce as it grows (because the fixed cost of producing more product is spread out over more revenue)
* Brand
  *  Peter does not go into great detail about this but I understood him to mean that the Monopoly should build an expectation that a certain standard of quality will be met and then follows up by  meeting the expectation. The words "delivering consistent results at or above expectations" come to mind.
